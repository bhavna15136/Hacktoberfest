Brief description to create a pull request for beginners

OS: Linux

Steps:
1. Fork the repository so that you can work on the repo locally.

2. Create upstream (Do it only once)
	
		git remote add upstream <clone_link>
    
you can get clone_link in Clone or Download.

3. Open the terminal and run below commands,

		git status
 		git add .
 		git commit -m "commit_message"
 
4. Run below steps to sync your branch with the master branch.

		git fetch upstream
 		git merge upstream/master
 
5. To final commit,
 
 		git push origin master
 
6. If there is something left on stack and you don't want it.
 
 		git stash

Note: Step 4 is not required if you are sure that the last commit is yours.
